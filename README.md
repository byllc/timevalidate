timevalidate
============

Some 12 and 24 hours time validation code for jquery and time inputs. I'm posting it here mostly or academic purposes, nobody likes code they wrote 5 years ago. 

Some more old code (~ 5 years old) that I found recently.  I'm just trying to get all of my snippets in one place. This one has been 
used in production for at least the last 5 years and seems to do its just just fine.
